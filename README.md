*Yet another (lite) toy N-body simulation*
--------------------

This mini package provides a proof-of-concept of N-body simulations of systems that evolve under only gravitational forces.

Currently Implemented Features
------------------------------

- Direct summation for force evaluation (which scales as $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$)
- 2nd-order symplectic and 4th-order non-symplectic integrators

Examples
--------

- An example of initial conditions for the Outer Solar System is provided at ./examples/initial_conditions_outer_solar.py
- For more details, please see the notebook ./Norbit_demo.ipynb
